**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)

# Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanchezcarlosjr/nvchad ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
1. Run :MasonInstallAll command after lazy.nvim finishes downloading plugins.
